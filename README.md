## Description

*Note: This plugin seems abandoned by it's original author, so I took over to ensure maintenance if needed.*

Sometimes when you divide up your WordPress content into categories it all ends up in sub-categories of one or two main categories that don't have any content themselves.

With the widget you can add a list of sub-categories even if the parent doesn't have posts.

You can display and filter sub-categories in various ways:

* Use the parent category as the widget title
* Show post counts in bracket next to the name
* Hide empty sub-categories
* Add a link to the parent category to the widget title
* Show the full sub-category tree so it include sub-sub categories and so on as well
* Display the list as dropdown rather than as links
* Use the first category of the current post as the parent
* Exclude one or more sub-categories from the list
* List the categories in reverse order

## Usage

1. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** or **Appearance > Customize > Widgets** in your WordPress admin.

2. Add the **Sub-categories** widget to any widget area (sidebar, footer, etc.).

3. Configure the widget options:
   - **Parent category**: Choose which category's sub-categories to display
   - **Title options**: Use custom title or parent category name as title
   - **Display options**: Show/hide post counts, empty categories, etc.
   - **Layout**: Display as list or dropdown menu
   - **Advanced**: Exclude specific categories, show full tree, reverse order

4. The widget will automatically display sub-categories of your chosen parent category.
